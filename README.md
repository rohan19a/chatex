# ChaTex is a text editor for LaTeX documents built with Electron. 

Key features include:
- Live preview: As the user types LaTeX code, ChaTex renders the result as a PDF preview using the pdf.js library. This allows seeing the formatted output update in real-time.

- LaTeX assistance: ChaTex uses the ChatGPT API to help generate LaTeX code from plaintext descriptions entered by the user. This simplifies LaTeX coding.

- Folder management: Users can open folders containing LaTeX projects. ChaTex displays the folder structure and files in a sidebar. Clicking a .tex file opens it for editing.

- Compilation: ChaTex provides a one-click compile button to run pdflatex on the open .tex file. Output is shown in the app.

- Autosave: Open documents are automatically saved periodically to avoid lost work.

- Side-by-side view: The editor, PDF preview, file structure, and compilation output can all be viewed side-by-side. Resizable panels allow customizing the layout.

- Cross-platform: As an Electron app, ChaTex runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux. The interface uses HTML/CSS/JS.

Overall, ChaTex combines a full-featured LaTeX editor with real-time previewing, AI assistance, and compilation utilities. Its folder management and ability to show various views side-by-side aims to boost productivity for LaTeX users.
